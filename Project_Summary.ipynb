    "\n",
    "MLB.com offers an online game titled, Beat the Streak. In the game players can attempt to beat Joe Dimaggio's hitting streak by picking a player that gets a hit in 56 consecutive games. Players are allowed to pick two players for each day and even pass on picking on a day. Since the game's inception in 2001, no online player has managed to beat the streak and win the grand prize of $5,600,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will attempt to model beat the streak as a classification problem. The machine learning models will attempt to predict which players have a high likelihood of getting a hit for a given day. Due to the importance of picking correctly, the machine learning models will be optimized for precision. Ultimately, the model will suggest one or a few batters out of hundreds as suggested batters for a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a very accurate model the probability of actually beating the streak is very low. The realistic goal of the project will be to see if the machine learning models can outperform baseball experts. If the models are relatively useful or accurate an online website could be set up to provide daily beat the streak recommendations. "
